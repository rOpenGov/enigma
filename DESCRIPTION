Title: Client for the 'Enigma' 'API'
Description: The company 'Enigma' (<https://www.enigma.com>) holds many public
    'datasets' from governments, companies, universities, and organizations.
    'Enigma' provides an 'API' for data, 'metadata', and statistics on each of
    the 'datasets'. 'enigma' is a client to interact with the 'Enigma' 'API',
    including getting the data and 'metadata' for 'datasets' in 'Enigma', as 
    well as collecting statistics on 'datasets'. In addition, you can download 
    a 'gzipped' 'csv' file of a 'dataset' if you want the whole 'dataset'. An 
    'API' key from 'Enigma' is required to use 'enigma'.
